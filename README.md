<h1>Augmented Reality Sphinx Model</h1>

<p>This project showcases an augmented reality experience using the Sphinx 3D model. By utilizing the A-Frame framework and AR.js library, the Sphinx model is rendered and overlaid onto a real-world marker using a web browser on compatible devices.</p>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A-Frame: A web framework for building virtual reality experiences that work across various devices.</li>
  <li>AR.js: An augmented reality library for A-Frame, allowing the integration of augmented reality into web applications.</li>
  <li>HTML: Markup language for structuring the content and components of the AR scene.</li>
  <li>JavaScript: Programming language for adding interactivity and logic to the AR application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Marker-based AR: The 3D Sphinx model is anchored to a physical marker, allowing it to be placed and interacted with in the real world.</li>
  <li>Model Animation: The Sphinx model rotates continuously in a full 360-degree loop over the course of 10 seconds.</li>
  <li>Information Display: A text component provides information about the Sphinx, displayed at the top of the AR scene.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Print out the marker image provided in the project or display it on another screen.</li>
  <li>Open the project in a web browser on a compatible device.</li>
  <li>Point the device's camera at the marker image, ensuring it is in view of the camera.</li>
  <li>The Sphinx 3D model will appear overlaid onto the marker, and the model will rotate slowly.</li>
  <li>The information about the Sphinx will be displayed at the top of the AR scene.</li>
</ol>

<p>Feel free to customize and enhance the project according to your needs!</p>
